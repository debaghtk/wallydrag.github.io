      <description>Just when I was having a sound sleep, I abruptly woke up. There were fireworks outside. So many that they woke me up and I am in no way a light sleeper. It was 12:15 AM Jan 1 2018.
I just missed new year countdown, and I was in Berlin. On a trip. All the plans of how amazing the new year would go in vain. But wait this was Berlin.</description>
