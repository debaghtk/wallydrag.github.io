      <description>I need to be the dumbest guy in the room
 this is what I told myself when I set out from college and began my career. I wanted to be at a place where I am surrounded by smart people, brilliant at their job, willing to learn and willing to teach.
Fortunately, an internship at Codeignition in the summer of 2014 gave me exactly that. I found people with proven credentials and wanting to stretch themselves even further, who not only expect nothing less from themselves but also from the people around them.</description>

      <description>Just when I was having a sound sleep, I abruptly woke up. There were fireworks outside. So many that they woke me up and I am in no way a light sleeper. It was 12:15 AM Jan 1 2018.
I just missed new year countdown, and I was in Berlin. On a trip. All the plans of how amazing the new year would go in vain. But wait this was Berlin.</description>
